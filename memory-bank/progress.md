### Legacy Code Reference Approach (2024-06-06)
- Established guidelines for working with legacy code from the old-version directory:
  - Use old codebase **only as reference** for understanding functionality
  - Study legacy components to understand requirements and data structures
  - Completely redesign and reimplement features using current architecture
  - Documented this approach in systemPatterns.md under "Workflow Rules & Legacy Code Handling"
- Added project-specific UI component guidelines in new ui-components.md reference
  - Documented which UI component libraries to use (Shadcn UI, Metronic template)
  - Provided examples of proper component implementation
  - Listed do's and don'ts for UI development
- Updated activeContext.md with legacy code reference workflow
  - Added step-by-step process for implementing features based on old code

### Workflow & Process Improvements (2024-06-09)
- Established a clear, repeatable workflow for feature migration and implementation:
  1. **Analysis**: Study legacy code for requirements and business logic
  2. **Planning**: Break down features into modular components, define TypeScript interfaces, and plan data flow
  3. **Design**: Create component structure with separation of concerns and reusability
  4. **Implementation**: Build features using modern React patterns, provider/context for data, and shared UI components
  5. **Integration**: Ensure features are fully responsive and work within the system architecture
  6. **Testing**: Validate all functionality, edge cases, and user settings persistence
  7. **Documentation**: Update the memory bank after each major change
- Always use shared Button and UI components for consistency
- Persist user settings (like NON_GPA_CODES) in localStorage for a better UX
- Use dialogs for settings/configuration, with clear labels and icons
- Refactor and optimize UI for clarity, space, and accessibility
- Never port legacy code directly; always rewrite with strict typing and modern patterns
- Document every major change and workflow update in the memory bank
