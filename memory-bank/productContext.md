# Product Context

## Purpose
- Enhance the user experience of the FPT University Academic Portal (FAP)
- Provide a modern, visually appealing interface using the Metronic template
- Improve usability without changing the underlying functionality
- Integrate additional features like Google Calendar for better student experience
- Support multiple languages to accommodate diverse student populations (Vietnamese and English)
- Create an inclusive, accessible academic portal experience

## Problems Solved
- Outdated or unappealing FPT Academic Portal interface
- Poor user experience with the existing design
- Limited visual hierarchy and organization of content
- Lack of modern UI elements and aesthetics
- Missing integration with calendar applications for schedule management
- Insufficient personalization options for students
- Difficulty in quickly understanding schedule information
- Lack of visual indicators for attendance status
- Poor information density and layout in schedule views
- Language barriers for international students and English-preferring users
- Inconsistent terminology across different parts of the portal

## How It Should Work
1. The extension activates when a user visits the FPT Academic Portal (fap.fpt.edu.vn)
2. It captures the HTML content from the original website and stores in window.data
3. The original content is removed from the DOM
4. React components extract and process the stored data
5. Authentication is handled via Supabase with Google OAuth integration if needed
6. The processed data is rendered within the new Metronic-based UI
7. Additional features like Google Calendar integration enhance functionality
8. The new interface replaces the original while maintaining all functionality
9. Language selection allows users to switch between Vietnamese and English
10. All user-facing text is dynamically translated based on language preference

## User Experience Goals

## Key Feature: Schedule of Week
The Schedule of Week feature is a critical component that displays a student's weekly class schedule. Our enhanced implementation:

- Displays statistics about attendance and upcoming classes

This enhanced schedule view solves several key problems:
- Difficulty in quickly understanding weekly commitments
- Poor visualization of attendance status
- Limited ability to plan ahead with calendar integration
- Insufficient context about course locations and details
- Language barriers for international students
